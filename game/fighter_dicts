Ground speed = the fighter's speed while in contact with the platform
Air speed = the fighter's speed while not in contact with the platform
A attack = the force of the fighter's faster attack
B attack = the force of the fighter's stronger attack
When a fighter is hit, multiply the force of the attack by their damage multiplier to get the increase in their damage score
Damage score corresponds directly to knockback.
